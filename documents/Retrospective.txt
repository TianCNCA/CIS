Branch Policy:
	We found that the branch policy we had did not work at all. We ended up having to solve a lot of conflicts at the end of the iteration, which was very bad. It blocked a lot of work.
	Therefore, we are switching to all committing in the main branch, this makes the conflicts smaller and easier to manage.
	The auto-generated database scripts and property files were not ignored at the beginning, and that caused a lot of conflicts, and took us a while to figure out. We will now ignore them moving forward.

Edit client was pushed back ultimately because of conflicts, which prevented us from testing a lot of functionality with the DB. We will fix this for iteration 3, and will try to stay more on top of our stories.
	We worked to finish it and communicated more to prevent these problems, also the conflicts from git being resolved will hopefully help in this.

Developer Task from iteration 0 were not very well defined. Searching for example, was not an important feature for a story. We treated it as a big user story, but it clearly wasnâ€™t. We will divide big user stories into more meaningful stories, that are split up better and more intelligently. We ended up dropping 

If we were to do it again, we would have 1 - 2 hours a day where we would pair program and get better results.

There was no consensus on how the GUI was supposed to look, so it took a while to get all the pieces working together. We solved this by coming up with a concrete design much later.

I (chris) realize now that I did the DB in a funny way, it was my first time using the DB, and I only added in random keys halfway through, rather than using the client name as the primary key. If I have time I will refactor this, but when we are updating or doing anything with the client name, it should really be the client id...
